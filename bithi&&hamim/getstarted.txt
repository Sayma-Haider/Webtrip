You might think what that code was all about. Well, let's find out.

1. The first line <!DOCTYPE html> is the document type declaration. It instructs the web browser that this document is an HTML5 document. It is case-insensitive.
2.The <head> element is a container for the tags that provides information about the document, for example, <title> tag defines the title of the document.
3.The <body> element contains the document's actual content (paragraphs, links, images, tables, and so on) that is rendered in the web browser and displayed to the user.
You will learn about the different HTML elements in detail in the upcoming chapters. For now, just focus on the basic structure of the HTML document.
