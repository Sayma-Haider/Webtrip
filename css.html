    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>CSS is the key presentational technology that is used in website design.
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is a standard style sheet language used for describing 
            the presentation (i.e. the layout and formatting) of the web pages. Prior to CSS, nearly all of the
            presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the HTML markup 
            (specifically inside the HTML tags); all the font colors, background styles, element alignments,
            borders and sizes had to be explicitly described within the HTML.
            As a result, development of the large websites became a long and expensive process, since the 
            style information were repeatedly added to every single page of the website.
            To solve this problem CSS was introduced in 1996 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), 
            which also maintains its standard. CSS was designed to enable the separation of presentation and 
            content. Now web designers can move the formatting information of the web pages to a separate style
             sheet which results in considerably simpler HTML markup, and better maintainability.
            CSS3 is the latest version of the CSS specification. CSS3 adds several new styling features and 
            improvements to enhance the web presentation capabilities.
    </p>
    <h3>Advantages of Using CSS</h3>
    <p>The biggest advantage of CSS is that it allows the separation of style and layout from the content 
        of the document. Here are some more advantages, why one should start using CSS?
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong> Save Lots of Time</strong>— CSS gives lots of flexibility to set the style properties of an element.
             You can write CSS once; and then the same code can be applied to the groups of HTML elements, 
             and can also be reused in multiple HTML pages.</li>
        <li><strong>Easy Maintenance </strong>— CSS provides an easy means to update the formatting of the documents, and to
             maintain the consistency across multiple documents. Because the content of the entire set of web
              pages can be easily controlled using one or more style sheets.</li>
        <li><strong>Pages Load Faster </strong>— CSS enables multiple pages to share the formatting information, which reduces
             complexity and repetition in the structural contents of the documents. It significantly reduces the 
             file transfer size, which results in a faster page loading.</li>
        <li><strong>Superior Styles to HTML </strong> — CSS has much wider presentation capabilities than HTML and provide much 
            better control over the layout of your web pages. So you can give far better look to your web 
            pages in comparison to the HTML presentational elements and attributes.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple Device Compatibility</strong> — CSS also allows web pages to be optimized for more than one 
            type of device or media. Using CSS the same HTML document can be presented in different viewing 
            styles for different rendering devices such as desktop, cell phones, etc.</li>
       
    </ul>

<!-----------------------------------------------------GETTING STARTED-------------------------------------------->

<div id="getstart">


        <h1>Getting Started</h1> 
        <p>CSS can be included inside HTML document through various ways.</p>
        
        <h3>Getting Started with CSS</h3>
        <p>In this tutorial you'll learn how easy it is to add style and formatting information to the 
            web pages using CSS. But, before we begin, make sure that you have some working knowledge of 
            HTML.If you're just starting out in the world of web development, start learning from here »
             Well, let's get started with the most popular style sheet language.</p>
        
        <h3> CSS in HTML Documents</h3>
        <p>You can include CSS in an HTML document in three ways:
            Inline styles — Using the style attribute in the HTML start tag.
            Embedded styles — Using the <<span>style</span>> element in the head section of a document.
            External style sheets — Using the <link> element, pointing to an external CSS file.
            In this tutorial we will cover all these three methods for inserting CSS one by one.</p>
        
        <h3>Inline Styles</h3>
        <p>Inline styles are used to apply the unique style rules to an element by putting the CSS rules 
            directly into the start tag. It can be attached to an element using the style attribute.
            The style attribute includes a series of CSS property and value pairs. Each "property: value" pair 
            is separated by a semicolon (;), just as you would write into an embedded or external style sheets.
            But it needs to be all in one line i.e. no line break after the semicolon, as shown here:
        
        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <pre><span><<span>h1</span>>style="color:red; font-size:30px;">This is a heading<<span>/h1</span>>
                   <<span>p</span>> style="color:green; font-size:22px;">This is a paragraph.<<span>/p</span>>
                   <<span>p</span>> style="color:blue; font-size:14px;">This is some text content.<<span>/p</span>>
        </span></pre>
        Using the inline styles are generally considered as a bad practice. As style rules are embedded 
        directly inside the HTML tag, it causes the presentation to become mixed with the content of the 
        document; which makes the code hard to maintain and negates the purpose of using CSS.
    </p>

    <h3>Embedded Style Sheets</h3>
   <p>Embedded or internal style sheets only affect the document they are embedded in.
       Embedded style sheets are defined in the <<span>head</span>>section of an HTML document using the <<span>style</span>> element.
        You can define any number of <<span>style</span>> elements in a HTML document but they must appear between 
        the <<span>head</span>> and <<span>/head</span>> tags. Here's an example:
   </p>
   <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\2.JPG" alt="Embede style sheet">

   <h3>External Style Sheets</h3>
<p>An external style sheet is ideal when the style is applied to many pages of the website.
An external style sheet holds all the style rules in a separate document that you can link from any HTML
 file on your site. External style sheets are the most flexible because with an external style sheet, 
 you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file.
 You can attach external style sheets in two ways — linking and importing.</p>

<h3>Linking External Style Sheets</h3>
<p>linking, we need to create a style sheet first. Let's open your favorite code editor and create a new file.
     Now type the following CSS code inside this file and save it as "style.css".</p>
<h4>Example</h4> 
<img src="img\bithi&&hamim\3.JPG" alt="linking external style sheet">
<p>An external style sheet can be linked to an HTML document using the <<span>link</span>> tag. The <<span>link</span>> tag 
    goes inside the <head> section, as shown in this example:</p>

<h5>Tip: Among all the three methods, using external style sheet is the best method for defining and applying styles to
     the HTML documents. As you can clearly see with external style sheets, the affected HTML file require minimal 
     changes in the markup.</h5>
<h3>Importing External Style Sheets</h3>
<p>The @import rule is another way of loading an external style sheet. The @import statement instructs the browser 
    to load an external style sheet and use its styles.You can use it in two ways. The simplest is within the header 
    of your document. Note that, other CSS rules may still be included in the <<span>style</span>> element. Here's an example:</p>
<img src="img\bithi&&hamim\4.JPG" alt="Importing external style sheet">
<p>Similarly, you can use the @import rule to import a style sheet within another style sheet.</p>
<img src="img\bithi&&hamim\5.JPG" alt="another way to external">

<p style="background-color: rgb(152, 160, 194);">Note: All @import rules must occur at the start of the style sheet. Any style rule defined in the style sheet 
     itself override the conflicting rules in the imported style sheets. However, importing a style sheet within another 
    style sheet is not recommended due to performance issue.</p>
    <br><br>
</div>



<!--------------------------------------CSS SINTAX-------------------------------------------------------->
<div id="elements">

<h1>CSS Syntax</h1>
<p>A CSS comprises of style rules that are interpreted by the browser and then applied to the corresponding elements
     in your document. A style rule is made of three parts −</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Selector</strong>− A selector is an HTML tag at which a style will be applied. This could be any tag like <<span>h1</span>> or <<span>table</span>> etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Property</strong> − A property is a type of attribute of HTML tag. Put simply, all the HTML attributes are converted into CSS properties. 
    They could be color, border etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Value</strong> − Values are assigned to properties. For example, color property can have value either red or #F1F1F1 etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block:</p>
<img  src="img\bithi&&hamim\selector.jpg" alt="Selector">
<p>To make the CSS more readable, you can put one declaration on each line, like this:</p>
<img src="img\bithi&&hamim\6.JPG" alt="selector1">
<p>In the example above h1 is a selector, color and text-align are properties and given blue and center are the 
    corresponding values of these properties.</p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(152, 160, 194);">Note: A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon ";", and the declaration groups are always surrounded by 
    the curly brackets "{}".</p>
 <h3>CSS Comments</h3>
<p>Comments are usually added with the purpose of making the source code easier to understand. It may help other 
    developer (or you in the future when you edit the source code) to understand what you were trying to do with the
     CSS. Comments are significant to programmers but typically ignored by browsers.
    A CSS comment begins with /*, and ends with */, See the example below:</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<img src="img\bithi&&hamim\7.JPG" alt="comments">
<p style="background-color: rgb(152, 160, 194);">Note:The // single-line comment style is NOT supported in CSS<br>
   The <<span>!-- ... --</span>> HTML comment style is also NOT supported in CSS
</p>
<br><br>
</div>



<!--------------------------------------------------------SELECTOR------------------------------------------------->
<div id="selector">
    <h1>CSS Selectors</h1> 
    <p>A CSS selector is the part of a CSS rule set that actually selects the content you want to style. 
        Let’s look at all the different kinds of selectors available, with a brief description of each.
    </p>
    <h3>Universal Selector</h3>
    <p>The universal selector, written as * i.e. asterisk or star symbol, matches every single element on the page. 
        The universal selector may be omitted if other conditions exist on the target element. This selector is often
        used to remove the default margins and paddings from the elements for quick testing purpose.
    </p>
    <h4>Example</h4>
    <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\8.JPG" alt="universal_selector">
    <p>The two lines of code inside the curly braces (<strong>padding</strong>,<strong>margin</strong>) will apply to all elements
        on the HTML page. As seen here, the universal selector is declared using an asterisk. You can also use the 
        universal selector in combination with other selectors.
    </p>
    <h3>Element Type Selector</h3>
      <p>An element type selector matches every instance of the element in the document tree with the 
          corresponding element type name.
      </p>
      <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\9.JPG" alt="element type selector">
      <p>The style rules inside the p selector will be applied on every <p> element in the document and color it
           blue, regardless of their position in the document tree.
      </p>
      <h3>Id Selectors</h3>
      <p>The id selector is used to define style rules for a single or unique element.
         The id selector is defined with a hash sign (#) immediately followed by the id value.
      </p>
      <h4>Example</h4>
      <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\id_selector.JPG" alt="idSelector">
      <p>This style rule renders the text of an element in red, whose id attribute is set to error. </p>

      <h3>Class Selectors</h3>
      <p>The class selectors can be used to select any HTML element that has a class attribute. All the elements 
          having that class will be formatted according to the defined rule.The class selector is defined with a period
         sign (.) immediately followed by the class value.
       </p>
       <h4>Example</h4>
       <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\class_selector1.JPG" alt="class_selector1">
       <p>The above style rules renders the text in blue of every element in the document that has class attribute set 
           to blue. You can make it a bit more particular. For example:</p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\Class_selector2.JPG" alt="Class_selector2">
        <p>The style rule inside the selector p.blue renders the text in blue of only those <<span>p</span>> elements
             that has class attribute set to blue, and has no effect on other paragraphs.</p>

       <h3>Child Selectors</h3>
       <p>A child selector can be used to select only those elements that are the direct children of some element.
          A child selector is made up of two or more selectors separated by the greater than symbol (i.e. >).
          You can use these selectors for example, to select the first level of list elements inside a nested list 
          that has more than one level.
       </p>
       <h4>Example</h4>
       <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\child_selector.JPG" alt="child_selector">
       <p>The style rule inside the selector ul > li applied to only those <<span>li</span>> elements that are direct
         children of the <<span>ul</span>> elements, and has no effect on other list elements.</p>

       <h3>Adjacent Sibling Selectors</h3>
       <p>The adjacent sibling selectors can be used to select sibling elements. This selector has the syntax like:
           E1 + E2, where E2 is the target of the selector.The selector h1 + p in the example below will select the <<span>p</span>>
            elements only if both the <<span>h1</span>> and <<span>p</span>> elements share the same parent in the document tree and <<span>h1<span></span>> is 
            immediately precedes the <<span>p</span>> element. That means only those paragraphs that come immediately after each <<span>h1</span>> 
            heading will have the associated style rules.
        </p> 
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\adjacent_sibling_selector.JPG" alt="adjacent_sibling_selector">


        <h3>General Sibling Selectors</h3>
        <p>The general sibling selector is similar to the adjacent sibling selector (E1 + E2), but it's less strict.
            A general sibling selector is made up of two simple selectors separated by the tilde (∼) character. It can be written like: E1 ∼ E2, where E2 is the target of the selector.
            The selector h1 ∼ p in the example below will select all the <<span>p</span>> elements that preceded by the <<span>h1</span>> element, 
            where all the elements share the same parent in the document tree.
        </p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\general_sibling_selector.JPG" alt="general_sibling_selector">
        <p>There are more selectors like attribute selectors, pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements. We will discuss 
            about these selectors in upcoming chapters.
        </p>


        <h3>Grouping Selectors</h3> 
        <p>Often several selectors in a style sheet share the same style rules declarations. You can group them into a
            comma-separated list to minimize the code in your style sheet. It also prevents you from repeating the 
            same style rules over and over again.
        </p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\group_selector.JPG" alt="group_selector">
        <p>As you can see in the above example, the same style rule font-weight: normal; is shared by the selectors h1,
             h2 and h3. So, it can be grouped in a comma-separated list, like this:</p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\group_selector1.JPG" alt="group_selector1">
        <br><br>
</div>

<!------------------------------------------------CSS COLORS---------------------------------------------------->

<div id="color">
 <h1>CSS Colors</h1>
 <p>The CSS color property defines the foreground color for an element.</p>
 <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\Color.jpg" alt="csscolors">
 <h3>Setting Color Property</h3>
 <p>The color property typically defines the color of the text content of an element.<br>
    For instance, the color property specified in the body selector defines the default text color 
    (foreground color in general) for the whole page.
</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Colors in CSS most often specified by the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li> HEX value - like "#ff0000"</li>
<li>an RGB value - like "rgb(255,0,0)"</li>
<li>a color name - like "red"</li>
</ul>
<p>Look at <a href="https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/css-reference/css-color-names.php">CSS Color Names</a> for a complete list of possible color names.</p>
<h3>CSS Background Color</h3>
<p>You can set the background color for HTML elements:</p>
<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue; text-align: center; color: white;">ICT 7Th Batch</h1>
<h4>Example</h4>
<img src="img\bithi&&hamim\background-color.JPG" alt="background-color">

<h3>CSS Text Color</h3>
<p>You can set the color of text:</p>
<h4 style="color:tomato">Hello World</h4>
<p style="color: dodgerblue;"> Hi!This is Hamima,A student of ICT in comilla University</p>
<p style="color:mediumseagreen">Comilla is a renowned district in Bangladesh</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<img src="img\bithi&&hamim\textColors.JPG" alt="textColors">

<h3>CSS Border Color</h3>
<p>You can set the color of borders:</p>

<h4 style="border:2px solid tomato;">ICT Department</h4>
<h4 style="border:2px solid dodgerblue">ICT Department</h4>
<h4 style="border: 2px solid violet;">ICT Department</h4> 
<h4>Example</h4>
<img src="img\bithi&&hamim\border-color.JPG" alt="border-color">
<br><br>
</div>


<!-------------------------------------------BACKGROUND------------------------------------------------->

<div id="background">

        <h1>CSS Background</h1>
        <p>CSS background properties are used to define background styles for the elements.</p>
        
        <h3>Background Properties</h3>
        <p>The CSS provide several properties for styling the background of an element, like: background-color, 
        background-image, background-repeat, background-attachment and background-position. The following section 
        will describe you how to use these properties to set the different styles for the backgrounds one by one.</p>
        
        <h3>Background Color</h3>
        <p>The background-color property is used to set the background color of an element.<br>
            The example below demonstrates, how to set the background color of a web page.</p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\background-color1.JPG" alt="background-color1">
        <p>Colors in CSS most often specified by the following methods:</p>

         <ul>
            <li> HEX value - like "#ff0000"</li>
            <li>an RGB value - like "rgb(255,0,0)"</li>
            <li>a color name - like "red"</li></ul>
        <p>Look at <a href="https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/css-reference/css-color-names.php">CSS Color Names</a> Names for a complete list of possible color names.</p>
        <h3>Background Image</h3>
        <p>The background-image property set an image as a background of an HTML element.<br>
           See the example below which demonstrates how to set the background image for a page.</p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\background-image.JPG" alt="background-image">

        <h3>Background Attachment</h3>
        <p>The background-attachment property determines whether the background image is fixed with regard
            to the viewport or scrolls along with the containing block.</p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\background-attachment.JPG" alt="background-attachment">

        <h3>Background Position</h3>
        <p>The background-position property is used to control the position of the background image.<br>
          If no background-position has been specified, the image is placed at the default top-left position
           of the element i.e. at (0,0). See the example below:</p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\background-position.JPG" alt="background-position">
        <p>In the following example, the background image is positioned at top-right corner and the position 
            of the image is specified by the background-position property.</p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\background-position1.JPG" alt="">

        <h3>The Background Shorthand Property</h3>
        <p>As you can see from the examples above, there are many properties to consider when dealing with 
        the backgrounds. It is also possible to specify all these properties in one single property, to shorten the 
        code. This is called a shorthand property. The background property is a shorthand property for setting 
        all the individual background properties (i.e., background-color, background-image, background-repeat, 
        background-attachment and background-position) at once. For example:</p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\background-shorhand.JPG" alt="background-shorhand">
       <p>Using the shorthand notation the above example can be written as:</p>
       <h4>Example</h4>
       <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\background-shorthand1.JPG" alt="background-shorhand1">
       <p>If the value for an individual background property is missing or not specified while using the shorthand 
          notation, the default value for that property will be used instead, if any.</p>
       <p style="background-color: aqua;">Note: The background properties do not inherit, but the parent element's background will be 
          visible through by default because of the initial (i.e. default) transparent value of the background 
          CSS property.</p>

<div id="font">
        <h2>CSS Fonts</h2>
        <p>The CSS font properties allows you to set various styles for fonts likes font family, size and boldness,
         variant, etc. of a text.</p>
        
        <h3>Font Properties</h3>
        <p>The CSS provide several properties for styling fonts of the text content, like: font-family, 
        font-style, font-variant, font-weight and font-size. The following section will describe you each one of 
        these properties one by one.</p>
        
        <h3>Font Family</h3>
        <p>The font-family CSS property allows you to set a prioritized list of font family name and/or generic 
        family name for the text content of a selected element.The font-family property can hold several font names 
        as a fallback system. List the font that you want first, then any fonts that might fill in for the first if 
        it is not available. You should end the list with a generic font family which are five — serif, sans-serif,
         monospace, cursive and fantasy. A font family declaration might look like this:</p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\font-family.JPG" alt="font-family">

        <p style="background-color: aqua;">Note: If the name of a font family is more than one word, it must be in quotation marks, like "Times New Roman",
         "Courier New", "Trebuchet MS" etc.</p>
        <h3>Font Style</h3>
        <p>The font-style property sets the font style for the text content of an element.
           The possible values for this property are: normal, italic or oblique.</p>
        <h4>Example
        <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\font-style.JPG" alt="font-style">

        <p style="background-color: aqua;">Note: At first glance both oblique and italic styles appear the same thing, but there is difference. 
        The italic style uses an italic version of the font while oblique text on the other hand is simply a
         slanted version of the normal font.</p>

        <h3>Font Size</h3>
        <p>The font-size property sets the size of font for the text content of an element.<br>
         There are several ways to specify the font size values e.g. with keywords, pixels or ems.</p> 
        <h3>Setting Font Size with Keywords</h3>
        <p>By setting a keyword font size on the body element, you can set relative font-sizing everywhere else on
         the page, giving you the ability to easily scale the font up or down on the entire page accordingly.
          An absolute size is specified using one of the following keywords: xx-small, x-small, small, medium, large, 
          x-large, xx-large.<br>
        A relative size is specified using one of the following keywords: smaller, larger.</p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\font-size-keywords.JPG" alt="font-size-keywords">

        <h3>Setting Font Size with Pixels</h3>
        <p>Setting the font size in pixel values (e.g. 12px, 16px, etc.) is a good choice when you need the
         pixel accuracy. However, the results may vary to some extent across the browsers, since they use different 
         algorithms to achieve the similar effect.<br>
         Defining the font sizes in pixel is not very accessible, because a user cannot change the font size from the
         browser settings. For instance, users with limited vision may wish to set the font size larger than the size
         specified by you. Therefore, you should avoid using the pixels values for font sizes if you wish to create an 
         inclusive design.</p>
         <h4>Example</h4>
         <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\font-size-pixels.JPG" alt="font-size-pixels">

       <p style="background-color: aqua;">Tip: The text can be resized in all browsers using the zoom tool. However, this feature resizes 
       the entire page, not just the text.</p>

       <h3>Setting Font Size with Em</h3>
        <p>The em unit refers to the font size of the parent element.<br>
        The size of an em value is dynamic. When defining the font-size property, an em is equal to the size of the
         font that applies to the parent of the element.<br>
        If you set a font-size of 20px on the body element, then 1em = 20px and 2em = 40px.<br>
        If you haven't set the font size anywhere on the page, then it is the browser default, which is probably 16px. 
        So, by default 1em = 16px, and 2em = 32px.
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\font-size-em.JPG" alt="font-size-em">

        <h3>Font Weight</h3>
        <p>The font-weight property specifies the weight or boldness of the font.<br>
         The possible values of font-style property are: normal, bold, bolder, lighter, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500,
        600, 700, 800, 900 and inherit.<br>The numeric values 100-900 specify the font weights, where each number 
        represents a weight darker than its predecessor. 400 is same as normal & 700 is same as bold.<br>The bolder 
        and lighter values are relative to the inherited font weight, while the other values are absolute font weights.</p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\font-weight.JPG" alt="font-weight">
        <p>Since most of the fonts are only available in a limited number of weights; often they are available only 
        in normal and bold. If the font isn't available in the specified weight, an alternate will be chosen that is the 
        closest available weight.</p>

        <h3>Font Variant</h3>
        <p>The font-variant property allows the text to be displayed in a special small-caps variation.<br>
        Small-caps or small capital letters are slightly different to normal capital letters, in which lowercase 
        letters appear as smaller versions of the corresponding uppercase letters.<br>
        The possible values for the font-variant property are normal, small-caps and inherit.</p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\font-variant.JPG" alt="font-variant">

    <h3>Text Color</h3>
    <p>The color property is used to set the color of the text. The color is specified by:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>a color name - like "red"</li>
    <li>a HEX value - like "#ff0000"</li>
    <li>an RGB value - like "rgb(255,0,0)"</li></ul>
    <p>Look at CSS Color Values for a complete list of possible color values.<br>
        The default text color for a page is defined in the body selector.</p>
    <h4>Example</h4>
    <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\text-color.JPG" alt="text-color">

    <h3>Text Alignment</h3>
    <p>The text-align property is used to set the horizontal alignment of a text.<br>
        Possible values for this property are: left, right, center, justify, and inherit.</p>
    <h4>Example</h4>
    <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\text-allignment.JPG" alt="text-allignment">
    <p style="background-color: aqua;">Note: When text-align is set to justify, each line is stretched so that every line has equal width, 
    and the left and right margins are straight.</p>

    <h3>Text Decoration</h3>
    <p>The text-decoration property is used to set or remove decorations from text.<br>
       Possible values of this property are: none, underline, overline, line-through, blink and inherit.
        You should avoid underline text that is not a link, as it might confuse the visitor.</p>

    <h4>Example</h4>
    <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\text-decoration.JPG" alt="text-decoration">

    <h3>Text Transformation</h3>
    <p>The text-transform property is used to specify uppercase and lowercase letters in a text.<br>It can be used 
    to turn everything into uppercase or lowercase letters, or capitalize the first letter of each word:</p>
    <h4>Example</h4>
    <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\text-transformation.JPG" alt="text-transformation">

    <h3>Line Height</h3>
    <p>The line-height property is used to specify the space between lines:</p>

        <h1>CSS Links</h1>
        <p>A link or hyperlink is a connection from one web resource to another.
        <h3>Styling Links with CSS</h3>
        <p>A link has four different states — link, visited, active and hover. These four states of a link or
         hyperlink can be styled differently through CSS properties using the pseudo-classes of anchor element,
        depending on what state they are in.<br>
        Here're the CSS pseudo-classes associated with HTML <<span>a</span>> tag that you can use to define the different styles 
        for the different states of a hyperlink.</p>
                
        <ul><li>a:link— Set styles for a normal or unvisited links that has no mouse pointer over it.</li>
            <li>a:visited — Set styles for a link the user has visited but has no mouse pointer on it.</li>
            <li>a:hover — Set styles for a link when the user place the mouse pointer over it.</li>
            <li>a:active — Set styles for a link that is in the process of being clicked.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>You can specify any CSS property you'd like e.g. color, font-family, background, etc. to each of 
        these selectors to redefine the style of links, just like you'd do with the normal text.</p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\link.JPG" alt="link">
        <h3>Background Color</h3>
        <p>The background-color property can be used to specify a background color for links:</p>

       <h4>Example</h4>
       <img src="img\bithi&&hamim\linkdecoration.JPG" alt="linkdecoration">
       <h3>Advanced - Link Buttons</h3>
        <p>This example demonstrates a more advanced example where we combine several CSS properties to 
        display links as boxes/buttons:</p>

        <h1>CSS Lists</h1>
        <p>The list properties used to control the presentation of list item markers.</p>
        
        <p>Types of HTML Lists<br>
        There are three different types of list in HTML:</p>
        
        <ul><li>Unordered lists — A list of items, where every list items are marked with bullets.</li> 
        <li>Ordered lists — A list of items, where each list items are marked with numbers.</li> 
        <li>Definition list — A list of items, with a description of each item.</li> </ul>
        <p>To know more about lists, please check out the tutorial on HTML lists.</p>
        
        <h3>Styling Lists with CSS</h3>
        <p>CSS provides the several properties for styling the most commonly used unordered and ordered lists.<br> 
        These CSS list properties typically allow you to:</p>
        
        <ul><li>Control the shape or appearance of the marker.</li>
            <li>Specify an image for the marker rather than a bullet point or number.</li>
            <li>Set the distance between a marker and the text in the list.</li>
            <li>Specify whether the marker or bullet would appear inside or outside of the box containing the unordered or ordered list items.</li>
            <li>In the following section we'll discuss about the properties that can be used to style lists.</li></ul>
        
        <h3>List Style Type</h3>
        <p>By default, items in an ordered list are numbered with Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, etc.),
            whereas in an unordered list, items are marked with round bullets. But, you can change this
            default list marker type to any other type such as circle, square, roman numerals,
            latin letters, and so on using the list-style-type property.</p>
